    <p>
      For as long as I can remember, I’ve been a creator and a tinkerer. Growing up during Y2K, I got hooked on coding
      through using blogs, where I could tweak the HTML or CSS a little and make my space truly my own. MINDBLOWN! Eventually, life took me through a few
      different careers, giving me plenty of experiences and skills, but my curiosity for tech never
      really went away.

      Ultimately, my time as a technology teacher reminded me how much I loved programming. In 2022, I completed
      School of Applied Technology’s (SALT) Fullstack JavaScript Developer Bootcamp, where I built fullstack
      applications and got hands-on with modern web technologies.

      After the bootcamp, while job searching, I took some time to figure out my next steps and focus on personal growth. I studied Swedish,
      going from SVA Grund up to SVA2, which was a fun challenge and kept me disciplined. Even though I wasn’t doing
      much coding during this period, my interest never went away, and it gave me the chance to reset, reflect, and get
      ready to dive back into software development with fresh energy.

      Currently, I’m studying in the Frontend Developer program at Futuregames Stockholm, sharpening my skills and
      learning the latest tools and best practices for modern web development.

    <p>
      I’m excited to bring both my technical skills and creative problem-solving mindset to new projects, building
      engaging and interactive web experiences.
